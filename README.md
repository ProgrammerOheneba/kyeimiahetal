This repository is dedicated to my MSc. Thesis/Project work. It contains all the codes and plots I created and generated throughout the course of my research.

The file "Study Area.ipynb" contains the script I used to illustrate and define my research's study area.
The file "Final Analysis & Plot (CESM+CIS).ipynb" houses the scripts responsible for the main plots and figures used in my article.
The file "Download_script*.ipynb" contains codes I used to download data from the International Laboratory for High-Resolution Earth System Prediction (iHESP) data server.
The remaining files are a mixture of trial versions and supporting notebooks that aided my analyses in achieving the goals of my project.
